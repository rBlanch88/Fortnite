  <h2> What is Fortnite? </h2>
  <p> Fortnite is a online third person shooter that has two games within its self.
    One of them is called "Save the World" but this webpage is focused on the other game which is called "Fortnite Battle Royal".
    In short, it’s a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a plane on to a small island and then fight each other until only one is left.
    Hidden around the island are weapons and items, including crossbows, rifles and grenade launchers, and players must arm themselves while exploring the landscape and buildings.
    It’s also possible to collect resources that allow you to build structures where you can hide or defend yourself.
    As the match progresses, the playable area of land is continually reduced, so players are forced closer and closer together.
    The last survivor is the winner.

  <h2> Battle Royal </h2>
  <p> Fortnite Battle Royale is a free-to-play battle royale game developed and published by Epic Games.
    It was released as an early access title for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One in September 2017, and for iOS in April 2018, with plans for an Android version at a later date. 
    Fortnite Battle Royal is a PvP game in which 100 players battle it out until one team is left standing.
  You can play squads with you and 3 other friends, duos with you and another friend, or take on 99 other players in solo.

  <h2> Gameplay </h2>
  <p> The point of the game is to land on the map, loot houses and buildings for weapons and items, eliminate enemies, and be that last one standing.
  But it's a lot easier said then done.
  The main gameplay for Fortnite Battle Royale follows the battle royale genre's standard format:
    up to 100 players skydive then deploy a glider from the "Battle Bus" onto the map, which includes random spawns of weapons, shield, and other combat support features.
    The goal is to be the last player or team, if you're playing in small squads alive by killing or avoiding other players.
    Over time, the game's safe zone (representing the eye of a storm that is ravaging the world), decreases in size, and players caught outside the zone will take damage, potentially dying.
    This directs the surviving players into tighter spaces, forcing player encounters.
    Players can loot defeated enemies for equipment.
    Random supply drops will occur during a match, providing random weapons and items.
    Fortnite Battle Royale's primary difference from other battle royale games is the building system.
    Nearly all objects in the environment can be broken down into materials (wood, stone, and metal), which can then be used to build fortifications with limited durability, such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs.
    These objects may be used to help traverse the map, protect the player from gunfire, or slow down progression of other players.</p>
  
  <h2> Battle Pass </h2>
  <p> Every season a new battle pass is released and cost a minimum of 950 V-bucks.
    It comes with up to 100 tiers of character skins, emotes, V-bucks, back blings, and gliders!
    By raising their tier, they gain automatic rewards of cosmetic items typically around a theme.
    The game as stated before is a free game but it is supported by microtransactions that allow players to buy "V-Bucks".
    V-Bucks are the game's internal currency.
    As of now there is only 2 ways of getting V-Bucks.
    One way is by completing missions or daily quests in the "Save the World" mode.
    The other way is buying them with actual money.
    V-Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player (heroes, character and weapon skins, and emotes).
    V-Bucks can also be used to buy Battle Passes which accelerate the rate that a player increases their Tier within the game's "seasons" (each season lasting a few months).
    Players can still increase tiers without a Battle Pass, but at a slower rate.

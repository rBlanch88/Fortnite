  <h2>Weapons</h2>
  <p>There are five different rarities with regards to weapons in Fortnite: Battle Royale.
    As you collect items from the map and from the loot chests that are sprinkled around the place,
    it's possible to get the same weapon, but with a different rarity.
    The better the rarity of that gun, the better its stats will be.
    Starting with the weakest and ending with the strongest,
    here's what you need to know about weapon tiers in the game:
    Gray is Common, Green is Uncommon, Blue is Rare, Purple is Epic, and Orange is Legendary.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Rifles</h2>
  <p>Among all the weapons in Fornite: Battle Royale,
    the trusty Assault Rifle rises above all of the rest when it comes to reliability.
    Submachine Guns, Shotguns and Rocket Launchers all serve a distinct purpose,
    from shredding enemies at close range, to blasting forts from afar.
    Assault Rifles are capable of dominating in both departments though, making them an essential element of anyone’s inventory.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Sniper Rifles</h2>
  <p>Essential for taking out targets at range,
    having a sniper rifle in your inventory can significantly increase your chances of slaying the competition and emerging victorious.
    Although you’ll have to perfect your aim and take into account bullet drop,
    landing a headshot with a sniper rifle will eliminate your opponent in an instant.
    Snipers also become increasingly important as matches drag on.
    One-versus-one duels increase in number as the clock ticks on, and as the circle tightens,
    holding a fixed position with a sniper rifle in tow allows you to spot targets and land critical hits without moving a muscle.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Shotguns</h2>
  <p>Shotguns are some of the strongest weapons when used at close quarters,
    and are capable of insta-killing enemies with their high-damage pellet blasts.
    While they’re not as versatile as an Assault Rifle
    - which can be used effectively at all distances
    - Shotguns excel at their main purpose
    - eliminating opponents when things get up close and personal.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Pistols</h2>
  <p></p>
  
  <h2>SMGs</h2>
  <p></p>
  
  <h2>LMGs</h2>
  <p>With version 2.4.0 of Fortnite: Battle Royale, Epic introduced a behemoth of a weapon into the game- the Minigun.
    It’s the perfect tool for kicking back,
    shredding enemies and toppling forts while quietly chuckling at the demise of those unfortunate enough to get in your way.
    a Light Machine Gun has been added to the game's arsenal.
    It's described as having a "fast rate of fire, large magazine, and slow reload". So it's basically as you'd expect,
    a hulking great thing that'll shred targets unfortunate enough to get in its way.</p>
  
  <h2>Explosives</h2>
  <p>I probably don't need to explain to you what a Grenade Launcher does
    (although it is worth pointing out that it uses regular grenades as ammo),
    and the Legendary version is very handy to have.
    Rocket Launchers are enormously helpful when it comes to smashing end-game forts to smithereens.
    It is also, of course, an extremely blunt yet effective weapon for handling opponents too.
    Just don't forget to bring a mop to clean up afterwards...</p>

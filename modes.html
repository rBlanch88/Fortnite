  <h2>Squads</h2>
  <p>Fortnite: Battle Royale's a completely different experience when you’re playing with a group of friends.
    When you’re solo you’ve only got to think about what’s best for you and no one else.
    So as long as you’re alive and your enemies aren’t, that’s fine.
    With three others in, you’ve got a lot more to think about.
    The most important thing in squads is communication.
    If you’re all constantly on the same page - even as your situation changes throughout the match
    - that’s already a significant boost to your odds of coming out on top.</p>
  
  <h2>Duos</h2>
  <p> While playing solo is an intense, solitary affair, playing with a wingman in tow adds an extra fun dimension to the game.
    It’s all about good cooperation.
    Fighting, building and exploring the environment with someone else requires its own type of strategic
    nous that’s far removed from the solo, ‘every man for himself’ attitude. You’ll have to build for each other,
    survive fights together and make sure you’re equally geared up as you roam the map.
    So there’s a lot to think about when it comes to playing with a friend.</p>
  
  <h2>Solo</h2>
  <p>Going it solo in Fortnite: BR is pretty stressful.
    It’s you versus the world and there’s no one to help you out when the going gets tough.
    This means it’s up to you - and only you - to make the correct decisions that'll lead you to building the right structures,
    getting geared up quickly and ultimately surviving fights.</p>
  
  <h2>LTM Modes</h2>
  <p>Sometimes updates will contain LTM’s or Limited Time Modes where the game is altered to provide a unique experience such as:
    explosives only, snipers only, or 50 v. 50 matches.
    These LTM’s are fun experiences for when you are just trying to relax and play with a group of friends.</p>

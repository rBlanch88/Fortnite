  <h2> What is Fortnite? </h2>
  <p> Fortnite is a online third person shooter that has two games within its self.
    One of them is called "Save the World" but this webpage is focused on the other game which is called "Fortnite Battle Royal".
    In short, it’s a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a plane on to a small island and then fight each other until only one is left.
    Hidden around the island are weapons and items, including crossbows, rifles and grenade launchers, and players must arm themselves while exploring the landscape and buildings.
    It’s also possible to collect resources that allow you to build structures where you can hide or defend yourself.
    As the match progresses, the playable area of land is continually reduced, so players are forced closer and closer together.
    The last survivor is the winner.

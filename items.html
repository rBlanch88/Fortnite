  <h2>Shields</h2>
  <p>Scattered throughout the entire map is loot but the most important are the consumables.
  There are two different types of shields to be found.
  One of the shields is called "Shield Potion" and when consumed it gives you 50 shield but it takes five seconds to drink.
  You can also stack two of them if you don't neet to use them at that moment.
  The other potion is called "Small Shield Potion" which restores 25 shield.
  It takes 3 seconds to drink one and small shields can only bring you to 50 shield.
  So if you have a small shield and a shield potion drink the small before the shield potion to get 75 shield instead of 50 
  and having to carry the small.</p>
  
  <h2>Meds</h2>
  <p>The maximum health you can have is 200.
  100 health, 100 shield.
  Bandages are common found around the map and comes in groups of 5.
  Each bandage restores 15 health but tops out at 75.
  Medkits on the other hand restore all 100 health, can be stacked to 3, but take 10 seconds to use.
  Also a "Cozy Campfire" can restore up to 50 health over time but you have to be close to it to be healed.
  recently added to the game were "Apples" which can be found near the bottom of some trees.
  Each apple with restore you with 5 health when consumed.</p>
  
  <h2>Shield & Meds</h2>
  <p>This section is about healers that restore health and shield.
  The first one is "Slurp Juice" which restores 25 health and 25 shield over time.
  The other one is a "Chug Jug" which restores 100 health and 100 shield.
  It has a legendary rarity so you won't find it often and it takes 15 seconds to consume.</p>
  
  <h2>Throwables</h2>
  <p>The "Boogie Bomb" explodes on impact and force anyone in the disco-splosion radius to ‘boogie’ for five seconds
  and be completly vulnerable.
  Romote Explosives (aka C4) are rare throwables that come is sets of 4 and can easily blow away enemies and their forts.
  A "Port-a-Fort" when thrown deploys a 3 story high fort made of metal to help get the high group on enemies.
  "Clinger" grenades come in sets of 3 and when thrown stick to whatever they land on. 
  They can be stuck to enemies when thrown to do 100 damage.
  Coming in sets of 3 "grenades" can be thrown and deal some serious damage.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Traps</h2>
  <p> The "Damage Trap" can be placed on walls, floors, and ceilings to do 75 damage to players.
  Even though it doesn't cause damage to players the "Launch Pad" as in the name launches you into the air 
  helping enter enemy forts or fly from the storm.</p>
